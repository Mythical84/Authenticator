Important Stuff
* Move api token to a .env file
* QR Code scanner using camera
* Better code for the timer
* Convert to firefox plugin
	* QR Code detecter
	* QR Code manual input
	* Parse QR Code
	* Autofill data
	* Automatically grab the website name when the code is input
	Ideas
		* Instead of converting into a plugin, display the website with the plugin,
			writing only functionality for QR Code and some other stuff that wouldn't
			be in the website such as autofill
		* The svelte compiler converts the website to pure js, so I might be able
			to just ship it as a plugin with minimal changes

Optimizations
* Find a proper way to cache the data that will persist between page reloads
